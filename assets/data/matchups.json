        "Early: Abuse Amumu's early game as hard as possible. Utilize your faster full clear speed to pressure lanes before him, and on your second clear, look to do Dragon. You are far stronger than him at this point in the game and can brute force objectives, not only because you will be there much earlier but also because he can't fight you at all, especially when you have already stacked your passive on Dragon.",
        "Mid game: Invading is rather valuable as long as you can guarantee that enemy laners can't move to rotate, because despite Amumu having a lot of CC, his damage is still rather low. As long as you can make sure to get multiple procs of your W, you will find the skirmishes to be easy. The biggest mistake you can make in the mid-game is to overextend without your team and get caught. There are mainly two goals you want to have in fights:",
        "1. You have to deny Amumu's engage on your team. This can be done just by CCing him with your Q. However, make sure you don't ever overextend yourself so that Amumu can't just one-man ult you and pick you off. Deny him, but do it from a safe distance. You might find it easy to do this by standing a bit in front of your team but a bit to the left or the right; this way, even if he goes on you, he is trading his own life.",
        "2. You have to not overextend to a point where you get picked off alone. This means you have to be selective with your fights. Play fights within your own vision and look to get picks that way. It is much easier to stay safe from enemy damage if you are the one controlling the vision and making the enemy facecheck, so prioritize control wards and your sweeper around objectives.",
        "Late Game: At this point, you struggle the most. While you have a good bit of tenacity, it still won't be enough to keep you safe in fights. As a result, it is very important for you to play through side lanes. While you might not win in 5v5s, 3v3s, 2v2s, and 1v1s are all really advantageous for you. So, choose to fight where they have fewer numbers, and your chances of winning will increase dramatically. Make sure to use the mechanics we've already talked about, as they can genuinely be the difference between a won and a lost fight."

As a result, the easiest way to punish her in this matchup is to use your clear speed advantage (approximately 15 seconds) to either gank lanes before she can respond or invade her on her final camp. When it comes to objectives, you'll always be able to take them because your 1v1 is far superior to Bel'Veth's, and so is your 2v2.

The best tip I can give you is to stay patient and use your Q when she dashes in and is right next to you.",

Feel free to use all your abilities on diana as she is always readily available for you to use W on.",
        "Mid: Use your Q to deny Diana big combos on your team with her ult, just make sure you press Q and insta right click her because if you do, even though you don't cancel the dash, she will be stunned after the dash and you significantly diminish the chances she has in creating an engage. If you are struggling to find spots to punish her just objective stack and she will be forced to fight you eventually.",
        "Late: Your role from mid to late doesnt change much, focus the first target and deny Diana's engage, you are stronger in fights just make sure you don't overextend and let diana make that mistake. In these skirmishes stacking passive and lethal tempo will increase your fighting prowess signfiicantly so whenever you can auto champions even if they are hyper tanks or even just minions is really important in allowing you to dish out damage."

Another important thing to do is buy control wards so she can't look for sneaky angles and threaten you carries, a control ward at this point of the game is stronger than any base item."

In fights you must watch fiddlesticks as it is not uncommon for fiddlesticks to channel ults even if they are in the thick of fights, your low Q cd will give you the ability to cancel his ult before he casts it so all you have to do is pay attention to him."

Alternatively, you can also chain Q E and R on Gragas to go for a certain pick but again you have to make sure the enemy has no CC to stunlock you and that your team can follow up. Remeber you don't need to go for any fancy plays, in matchups like these just take an objective lead, look to get soul as early as possible and win the game through it.",

Objectives are always free because Ivern has no fighting prowess, invades are hard even though Ivern has to mark his camps because he is still faster on his clear, so make sure your plays are on lanes and objectives instead. Importantly make sure to ward the opposite side of what you're starting level 1 because Ivern can cheese your camps and especially a buff level 1.",
        "Mid: At this point fights are really hard if you don't dictate what happens, Ivern takes away one of your biggest strengths of punishing facechecks with his bushes so you have to rely on good macro. There are two types of plays you should go for, 1. plays on ivern with your Ult buffering his snare, this will work is because if you focus ivern his champ is much less useful. it will be difficult to get onto him though so you need to find unique angles to go on him. 2. Plays on side are extremely strong, Ivern is a champion that wants to group because he finds strength the more numbers around him and the more frontline he has, and thus has the tendency to overgroup, he will not be able to match your mobility to make plays on side and he will also have less coverage, making it easier to punish him",
        "Late: At this point of the game, Ivern is extremely dangerous, he can one shot you with his Q and his ult is extremely dangerous, he can one shot your backline and you. This is why you must play teamfights where his ability to assasinate is significantly reduced. It is also important that you are there early for objectives because due to his low defensive/hp stats and your 1 second stun from Q his ability to facecheck is extremely limited even though he has Ult as insurance. Another important thing to do is buy control wards so he can't look for sneaky angles and threaten you carries, a control ward at this point of the game is stronger than any base item."

When going for objectives, ensure you have prio and correct setup, as Jarvan can match your early prowess and carelessness can be deadly. He can't outsmite if you chain your E damage with Smite.",
        "Mid: On 1st item you are stronger than Jarvan in 1v1s, but he has an insane amount of burst damage you must account for. Do not greed your ult if he combos you, since deaths at this stage often lead to objectives—which you want to control in such a close matchup. In fights, focus the first target and avoid standing too close to your team; this just gives Jarvan a valuable multi-man ult. Make sure he either ults your team or you, not both. Also avoid trading ult for ult with him because yours has a longer CD—position respectfully.",

Use in-and-out zoning pressure on their carries with your Q and ult, and always mark the Jarvan in fights. Do not start fights when he is out of vision; his damage is underrated late and his ability to set up big combos is similar to Fiddlesticks—keep track of his position."

You will decimate karthus in skirmishes but still try to avoid as many Qs as possible as they still do damage. You can always secure objectives in this matchup as it is hard for him to kill you on objectives given your healing from W and shield from E.",
        "Mid: After your 1st item you can't lose skirmishes vs karthus, your extra movement speed is crucial in allowing you to dodge karthus Qs so make sure you abuse this advantage. Regarding skirmishes you don't have to focus karthus but given karthus doesnt have the longest range and is quite squishy, you can punish him quite easily. In addition, make sure you secure all the objectives possible because karthus does scale like a monster so you need some scaling factor to combat him.",
        "Late: At this point of the game, Karthus is extremely strong but there isn't anything special you want to do, the key things to watch out for are that karthus does have a tendency to be caught due to his short range so use your extensive movement speed to look for picks on him as you can still pick him off and stay healthy due to your E and W. In teamfights, simply play for your teams wincon and don't try to trade 1 for 1 with karthus if you don't have to as his passive makes those 1 for 1s extremely worth for him. Finally make sure you are the one with control around objectives as karthus has a really hard isuse walking in to objectives zones if he as no control."

        "Mid game: This is the part of the game where you have the biggest advantage, especially with your 1st item, kayn can never even come close to killing you. That being said after form kayn is extremely mobile and can snowball the game, this is why deep vision and info of Kayn's whereabouts is extremely valuable in denying Kayn's ability to snowball.especially on side lanes. Again, the key to winning matchups like these is stacking objectives, you want to make sure you reduce random fighting which gives kayn the opportunity to snowball and rather focus on stacking objectives so you have an eventual win con that will combat Kayn's insane late game prowess.",
        "Late Game: At this point in the game, while Kayn is extremely strong, you can still probably beat him in a 1v1 if he is in blue form. Yet, a good kayn will never try to 1v1 you and would try to poke you and get out, that's why its important to group with your team as much as you can and try to punish Kayn in teamfights. In fights you need to be extremely patient with your Q, Kayn always has to eventually jump in to damage so you need to be patient and wait for that opportunity to stun him. In fights you have to watch out for kayn due to his extreme burst potential so until you see kayn make sure you don't blow all your cooldowns as it can be costly. In addition to this vision control is important because the less control you have, the easier of a time kayn has to pick your teammates. Make sure to use pings to alert your team of potential kayn engages as well, it will help a lot."

After 2 items you are much more tanky and you can be a bit careless, but throughout the mid game you want to continue stacking objectives as again, Khazix struggles significantly in teamfights when champions are grouped up so playing around objectives makes it easy and straightforward for you to play the game out in addition to giving you a clear win con to play for (soul stacking)",

In addition to this you want to try to stack objectives as much as possible just make sure you get the appropriate prio and you can do so. Key things to watch out for, 1. try to deny kindred marks they are very valuable for her if she gets them and can make her hell to deal with in the mid to late game (her 1st mark will always spawn on either scuttle so just make sure you use your clear speed to get into a good position to contest either) 2.

In addition to this, make sure you are permanently clearing your camps because if you don't, Kindred will mark those camps and giving him those marks can be extremely costly at this stage of the game . In teamfights again, hold your Q until the end of kindred's ult so you can gurantee killing her, also you don't have to W Kindred, as talked about in the mechanics guide, W the person you can hit the most often.",

        "Early: In the Early game your matchup is kind of even, lee sin has a slower clear but in 3v3s if you overextend he can punish you hard just like you can punish him if he overextends except he has a bit more insurance with his dashes. Having understood this, stacking objectives is a bit harder and you would really need good set up from your lanes t otake any objective. My advice would be to try to gank a lane first so you can gurantee a numbers advantage before you play for any objective. Remember lee sin can secure objectives with his Q so don't let him gain entry towards the objective. Remember in fights Q towards the end of your E so you can gurantee it landing.",
        "Mid: After your 1st item because you are going cleaver or tri force and not cosmic, you are much stronger than lee sin individually, I will say short trades are probably still beneficial for him, so make sure everytime you are skirmishing him you have the ability to go for an extended fight and not short trades. In addition to this remember lee sin will look to kick you so use your ult to buffer the kick whether it be defensively (more common) or offensively (less common).",
        "Late: At this point Lee Sin is completely outscaled, just make sure that you deny his ability to kick one of your carries into his team so just watch lee sin at the start of the fight and ensure he can't get a clean or easy engage. As long as he doesn't get that his champ is rather useless so you can just play for your team's win con whether it be kiting a carry or diving into enemy backline and disrupting"

So, the way you play the game is again by playing good macro, track naafiri before fights, make sure your side laners are aware if she could be there and never ever go for reckless engages and focus on denying Naafiri opportunities in fights instead. Now if enemies are in really bad positions go for the pick, elsewise don't overextend yourself to the point where you can't help your carries.

You outpace Nidalee in your full clear but not by much so any gank you go for, you have to acknowledge the possibility of Nidalee coming to countergank. It is for this exact reason that you also recklessly start objectives like you can in many other matchups, make sure that when you start objectives, there is 0% chance they can contest and that nidalee can't enter the pit because Nidalee has insane skirmishing power and her Q allows her to win every smite fight.",

Farming is not as important in this matchup, if you need to skip camps to be first at objective set ups, do so, having a soul win con is key to being able to win this matchup, punishing facechecks is the only real advantage you have over Nidalee.

That being said if you can use your clear speed advantage to generate some sort of lead for your teammates, the game will become super straightforward to play out because you will be able to stack objectives easily and Nocturne is just not a great champ without winning lanes. Try to get a little bit of an xp lead and get bot or mid lane a lead and it will make the rest of your game much easier, remeber to track Nocturne's 6 and when he is about to hit 6 warn your teammates, you can even do this prematurely if you are unsure when he will hit 6.",

What you can also do, if nocturne ults you, is to R back to your team so Nocturne will be out of position and you can easily take out an enemy before the fight even commences. Now, if nocturne ults one of your teammates, you must insta rotate to kill nocturne because at this point his burst is significant and can take out one of your carries easily. Objective stacking as always is going to be important, avoid making plays on side because Nocturne's global ult allows him to match your numbers easily.",

THhe main thing you should watch out for in the early game is Nunu's ability to sneak drake with Q, if possible, try to drop a trinket in the drake pit after your 1st clear to avoid Nunu being able to sneak drake. In addition to this, since nunu is a champion that spams ganks, use trinkets readily on your 1st clear and also make sure to ping to alert your team of possible nunu ganks. Nunu only has 2 ways to beat you, 1. he spam ganks gets all his lanes ahead, 2. he sneaks the first drake and just uses dragon soul as a win con.

While nunu is not a threat in teamfights, nunu's champion specializes in being able to generate picks on sides so again, pings, controlwards and vision set up are extremely important. If you feel like one of your sidelaners are really far extended, go and hover them if you win the skirmish. Remember again, when going for objectives don't flip smites, ensure Nunu has no acces, then take the objective.",

Pathing to bot in this matchup is also really valuable as in a matchup so even, the one that takes the objective leads generally has the easier path in the mid to late game. Remember to not instantly blow your whole combo on Pantheon before he E's, personally in some situations I even like to use my Q and W insta, and hold E until after he Es. Throughout the whole game, NEVER FLIP SMITE, pantheon Q smite combo is one of the best executes in the game and you will never win against it so clear out the perimeter and gurantee the objective is unconested otherwise turn.",

In fights remember try to attack pantheon from front and back so he can't E all of your damage and never make plays on side when pantheon still has ult because his countergnaking potential and global ult are really broken at this stage of the game. In fights, if pantheon ults and jumps on backline try to peel him off, you should be able to do that easily and punish his overextended position.",

In objectives watch out for poppy's ult because he can throw you out of the fight and rob you of the drake very easily, don't greed your ult, if you think her ult might hit you just use your ult to buffer it and you won't be knocked away. Skirmishes inside of the jungle tend to not be the best due to the vast amount of walls Poppy can E you on so unless you have an advantage, try to keep most fights in the lane where poppy's short range can be punished by your ranged carries.",

Again be first on objective set ups and use your Ult to buffer her ult if needed, it's really worth trading ult for ult.

        "Late: Your role in mid to late doesn't change, you need to focus qiyana in fights and deny her a big engage at any cost.

In fights if Qiyana does get a big ult on your team, react to it with your own ult buffer it and insta go to deny any follow up by zoning enemy champs with your Q.

This stage of the game objective should always be yours rammus really doesn't have a steal threat and he definitely doesn't have the combat prowess to contest objective skirmishes or objective positioning. Remember either build you go, rammus doesn't really block most of your damage (cleaver armor cut/ cosmic is ap) so he is not as tanky vs you as he would typically be vs bruisers just use your auto cancel mechanics and you will melt him like butter. Also it can be easy to just fall in love with fighting make sure before you fight you cycle your camps because you're much faster at doing that and if he wants to match your skirmishing you will gain an xp and gold lead from the camp lead you will have.",
        "Late: Rammus at this stage is good to do one thing, E you, just draw an imaginary line with your team and try to stay aligned with them. Now remember just like always objective control is important if you need to skip camps to do it then do so. Rammus is very quick with his Q so proper vision will be needed to keep track of possible flank entries onto your backline, if he manages to E your adc at this point in the game it is likely a death sentence for oyur adc so watch out for that."

You hard outpace him in full clearing so the only real chance he has in winning the early game is by cheesing, as said before raptor ward is the best but pinging and alerting your team to ward is important. Most reksais' full clear at 3:30 so you have a huge timer before they finish, this means you can help bot and mid much earlier. On the second clear, again your clear speed advantage should get you not only a better position to gank but also easy access to drake.",
        "Mid: In mid game reksai is a champion much lije volibear, she is a bit more reliant on people to walk onto him because he isn't that tank so engaging is difficult so make sure you arrive to skirmishes and objective set ups early to exploit Reksai's weakness in facechecking and engaging. Now in skirmishes, Reksai as a champion is clunky and simplistic, she kinda relies on overextending to be useful and his only safety mechanism is her ult. It is because of this reason, in fights, let Reksai go in, she will overextend herself almost always and your job is to punsih it, don't complicate the game, make it easy and just capitalize on her kit's weakness.",
        "Late: In the late game Reksai is kind of just a knockup bot, the issue is she can knock up multiple targets at once as a result, you need to do two things. 1. You can't stick right next to your teammates you need to stand a fair distance apart to make sure reksai can't get multi man engages, 2. you need to ensure you stop reksai's engage with your Q if he attempts to reach your backline. Now, if you have the control in the game doing this is much easier, if you don't have control lets say for an objective, push through mid lane force them to respond then take the control. I go through this in the jungle guide on my youtube but especially vs Reksai playing in lanes is really good as it makes it hard for him to go for unique, out of vision engages."

On your second clear, try to look for a gank into drake, at this point in the game rengar is only strong if you fight around bushes so if you have control and stay within drake pit rengar's threat is extremely low. Make sure that you escort your laners though or at least have good vision because from experience Rengar tends to have the ability to pick off your laners moving to help yiou with drake.",
        "Mid game: In the mid game Rengar is only useful when he has 2 things, bush control or ult. Now, by far the most important thing when playing against Rengar is you never facecheck bushes if you don't have either numbers or vision. Now vision is great to have and it's easy to get, simply be first on objectives and you will always have the vision control. However, there will be some instances where you are late so you need to have numbers, the easiest way to ensure you have numbers if by pushing mid wave first and then moving. By this doing you force someone on the enemy team to respond to the wave while your entire team is freed up because there is n owave to push. This way you completely negate Rengar's ability to use bushes to get free picks. Regarding rengar's ult, in fights just let him go in, when he ults he is on a timer so he has to force it eventually if you go in while he pops ult, you just give him easy access into your backline. What you should instead do is let him make the play and then insta focus him once he ults in, never dive for backline always stay on the rengar!",
        "Late: Your role in mid to late doesn't change significantly, I will say the main difference is your ability to facecheck bushes, after you get 3-4 items, rengar can't really threaten you and if he does jump on you then you will just kill him. The only way he does kill you is if they have multiple champions there and you get CCd by either rengar e or somethign else so just watch out for that, stick to good fundamentals and you'll be fine. Remember just because you are hard to kill doesn't mean your team is, same rule applies, let rengar make the mistake then capitalize on it, don't go in when he pops ult, force him to go in and punish."

        "Early: Utilize your clear speed advantage to be the first to make plays, in the early game your advantage lies in 1v1s, your disadvantage lies in the fact that in 2v2s or 3v3s, sejuani can chain cc you long enough for her team to kill you so just becareful you don't overextend and you will be fine. If you want to take objectives at this stage of the game, you have to have proper set up because Sejuani has a lot of damage early game and as said earlier they can burst you so don't underestimate her just because of her tanky nature and ensure lanes are pushed and vision is set up.",
        "Mid game: This is the part of the game where you can generate the biggest lead, in the mid game sejuani players will always overuse their tempot to try to create players so what you need to do is either match these plays and if you can't, try to create invades and generate a camp lead. Remember just cause sejuani is skipping her camps doesn't mean you should be doing the same thing, her champion is far lower econ than you so it is in her interest if you skip camps and amtch her on 50/50 plays. Sure, if you can match her and get a kill do so, but if your laners are safe don't skip camps unless you need to. In addition, in matchups like this make sure you take as many objectives as you can, skipping camps to be there to set up the objective is advantageous because sejuani's champion is stronger when you have no info as it allows her to go for creative engages with her ult and get a pick before the fight even starts so if you need to skip camps to acquire vision do so. In fights very simple, focus the first target sejuani isn't mega tanky at this point and you have the damage to wreck her, if she ults you you can either ult away if the fight is bad or ult on her if the fight is good and slight buffer the stun.",
        "Late Game: At this point Sejuani is the strongest, her ult is on low Cd and she wil often just throw it out to fish for plays. What this means is you need to be good enough to make sure you never are far up enough that you can be killed without your team being able to retaliate, hopefully by this point you have enough tenacity to frontline, use this to spearhead your team when you are trying to take zones of vision, if enemy team is there first, push waves force them to respond then retake the vision. In fights it'll be common for you to use ult defensively, this is really good at this point because your ult damage is negligible so if you want to trade ult for ult in important fight, do so. Remember however your ult has a longer cd so don't trade ults unless it's close to an objective timer. Finally in fights just try to survive and frontline as long as possible, use your W's on sej because she is a very accessible target and can keep you healing throiughout the fight."

        "General Macro: Deny his early cheese, and be first to plays",
        "Early: This is the toughest part of the game to navigate, this is the only matchup in the game where yo u want to start sweeper, then what you want to do is around 1:15, invade enemy raptors with sweeper and take out all of shaco's boxes. The reason you want to do this is so that Shaco can't lvl 2 cheese you on your camps and just make the early game a cheesefest and gain a significant lead. Now if you don't do this, the easiest way to play against shaco is just to expect him to be on your camps this means pulling camps into bushes will help significantly. After the first clear the matchup becomes infinitely easier, just play like normal, get prio into stacking drakes, don't be afraid to play 3v3s but be awarwe of what summoner spell shaco has because if he has ignite it can sway these fights massively. In addition, when going for ganks just be aware shaco can be there he has insane mobility and his much faster clear speed will allow him to do so, it is for this reason that its also good just to ping your laners to becareful at around 3:05-3:10 because shaco can gank them on this timer.",
        "Mid: In the mid game, if shaco goes ap the boxes can be extremely annoying so again sweeper AND control wards are key to denying him this especially around objectives. Again because boxes are so op, being at objectives first allows you to deny shaco boxes and it also forces him to facecheck into you which gives you a timer to punish him if not kill him. In fights if you mark shaco its easy to kill the right one but even if you don't just look at who is taking more damage and you will know that is the clone because shaco clones always take more damage than the real version. Your role in fights is simply to either kill the first target or protect your carries, this can mean the same thing and if shaco does go on your teammates, turn all your attention onto him and it will take away a lot of his power.",
        "Late: In the late game shaco's power goes down significantly the only annoying thing are the boxes so just dont care about your camps at all if you need to be at objectives, if you are there first his champion is half as useful as he would normally be. In fights shaco can be very shify, unless he jumps on your team there is no reason to focus him and your primary objective should just be to bundle with your team and deny shaco any free picks. Rember, your Q can catch people but specifically shaco off guard easily if you don't give it much wind up time so Qing him insta when he is next to you instead of charging it could be extremely advantageous. Last thing, always mark shaco in fights so you can identify his potential targets and preemptively move to deny him that opportunity."

Before your first base, pop a ward on drake because  Shyvannas love sneaking drake after first base and can rush them. Look to drake on your 2nd clear and with decent set up it will always be free because again skirmishes are unloseable. ",
        "Mid: In the mid game, the only thing you need to keep track of are drakes, shyvannas power comes from her ability to stack drakes so denying this is extremely important. This means you need to be on time at drakes so Shyvanna can't rush it whilst at the same time balancing clearing your camps, because if you don't, shyvanna is a champion that can clear camps so quickly and get ahead if you ignore your camps. In fights, Shyvanna can be annoying as a poke champ so try to either look to hard engage on her and if you do take damage, heal the poke off with your W. If you don't hard engage, you can look for a quick Q to force her ult and then just give up positioning until her ult times out and she is significantly weaker.",

On top of this, your flash cooldown is important, with flash you are able to look for quick, snappy plays that shyvanna hates playing against, this is also the reason ionian boots are very valuable. In my opinion, farm doesn't matter late game, you will hardly get any tankier or stronger damage wise, positioning on the other hand is way more important and is something you should focus on. If you manage to ever stun shyvanna she can't escape you because of your iceborn gauntlet along with Q short cd chain CC so just remember if you touch her once, don't let her scurry away, her ult is not a long dash and is definitely not enough to escape you."

If you manage to ever stun shyvanna she can't escape you because of your iceborn gauntlet along with Q short cd chain CC so just remember if you touch her once, don't let her scurry away, her ult is not a long dash and is definitely not enough to escape you."

        "Early: You have a faster clear than Taliyah however since Taliyah has fast movement speed with her passive, unless enemies are mega pushed up, she will likely be able to somewhat counter your gank so it's important to acknowledge this and if a gank isn't likely, playing for a pick on taliyah finishing her clear or playing for positioning for scuttle is significantly better. On second clear, look to do drake if you can secure vision control, Taliyah is horrible at facechecking so if she does you can even flash stun on her and you will anhilate her. If you don't have prio then make sure you are aware of entering bushes because even at this stage, Taliyah has pretty good burst when you facecheck her.", 
        "Mid: After level 6 you hard fist taliyah whenever you want to, always just ult on her and you will be able to kill her easily, she can never survive if you enter into melee range of her so if she walks up just ult on her uneless she has help nearby. After your 1st item, the game becomes infinitely easier, you will be able to steamroll Taliyah even if you just hit an E. Honestly the important thing to do in the mid game is just take control, if you do she can't facecheck and all the objectives are free, if she gets positioning it could prove troublesome if you don't react to Ws so if you are late, keep your eyes peeled for Taliyah W's from out of vision. Remember Taliyah ult allows her to match your plays on side if you ever go for them so just respect that and ensure you include the possible presence of her when going for plays.",
        "Late: At this point of the game, you can still win fights by ulting onto Taliyah however she has INSANE burst, this means when she has flash you can't be reckless with your engages it might also be smart to stun her first before you Ult and use your Ult as a secondary engage point which allows you to reengage on taliyah if she repositions. Again, Taliyah is much stronger when she holds vision control so deny that and take control and the fights will be extremely free. On top of this when looking for plays on sides be aware taliyah can match you with her ult so always respect and pay attention to that."

Your fullclear speed is quick, talon can match you on ganks though so if you are making plays make sure to hug the far end side of the wall if you are low so talon can't just insta parachute on you. If you have good prio for drakes they will be free, Talon struggles in straight up brawls and is more dependant on catching people in transition and snowballing off of it, this is why vision is import and just going and playing for objectives where your team is grouped up will deny him that opportunity whilst giving you the soul win con.",
        "Mid: In the mid game this is where Talon can snowball leads and is thus the most dangerous. There are 2 things you must do, 1st its important you are always clearing your camps and not making random plays, if the plays you go for are not done when your camps are down, talon will use his 4 billion dashes to take your camps this will put him at a huge Xp surplus so it's extremely important you make plays after you finish full clears. The second thing you should do is set up good vision and hover your side lanes if need be, talon is extremely mobile and can pick off your side lanes at ease, vision will help but pings are probably way more important. The most important thing is to deny your laners from dying stupid deaths, just hover them to push out the lanes so they won't have to be in a dangerous position by themselves. In fights just let talon jump in and then play, you never want to be the one engaging because when you engage you leave gaps and holes this allows Talon to thrive in the position he wants the most so its easier if you play counter-engage in this matchup rather than engage.",
        "Late: Your role in the late doesn't vary much, protect your sidelanes ping them if you need to, in fights focus on talon when he jumps in. Engages should not be your focus, play to collect control and use your abilities as anti engage. Remember even at this stage of the game don't skip camps unless you need to as again, Talon will just use his 40 wall hops to accumulate a gold and xp lead which still matters significnatly at this stage of the game. Remember good vision will allow you to identify where Talon is coming from, making your job as counter engage much easier."

On the second clear ideally you go for drake the only issue is that if you go for it without prio, trundle can be a nuisnace and you wouldn't be able to get the drake so just make sure you have the correct set up and go for it, if trundle comes you can pick him off easily he has almost no mobility and his tankiness at this stage of the game ie extremely negligible.",
        "Mid game: The mid game is where people make the most mistakes, Trundle is extremely strong after he's 6 and if you just stand there and fight him like you would 99% of other junglers you will lose. The best thing though, is if you go cosmic drive you will be able to drop an E on trundle and run away because you will have much faster movement speed than him. So, the best play you can make in fights is chunk trundle out with your combo then when he ults you insta run away with cosmic movement speed. When his ult finishes, reengage into combat with him and the skirmish will be significantly easier. The main thing you need to watch out for in mid game is to not let trundle stack drakes, when trundle stacks drakes you will have to run into him and doing this in and out gameplay will be significantly harder so try to put a priority on setting up objectives and the game will be easy.",
        "Late Game: In the late game trundle is a sitting duck, he is very immobile and this means going for picks on him are extremely easy. That being said if trundle ults you, you can't just stand there and brawl with him just like in mid game you need to space him and if that means you don't kill trundle, you can be happy with taking his ult- the only spell that gives him any relevance at this stage of the game. Again, being first to objectives is nice as it allows you to have that ability to space trundle if need be, making plays on sides are also well advised because trundle is kind of immobile and prefers to go for teamfights in the jungle with all of his team."

If you have prios, try to take the drake after your 2nd full clear, if you don't, Udyr will try to take the drake on 2nd clear try to deny him even if you are late to it as you should be stronger than him at skirmishes, and your single target burst is way higher so just focus one target and the skirmishes are won.",

Even when objectives are down, instead of trying to go for even, 4v4 or 3v3 skirmishes mid, you can utilize your ult to go for creative plays on sides to try to create a numbers advantage and a gold lead for your team.",
        "Late: In the late game Udyr is tanky and has significant amounts of damage, however just like you he is pretty useless when focused by an entire enemy team. This means you should put a priority on 2 things 1. try to get positioning for objectives, if you can do so you make him facecheck this means he can't react in time with awaken E but it also means your team has a very easy time focusing him down insta, 2. in fights you have to focus on peeling your carries, if you dive in you are going to get focused down if Udyr goes in he will get focused down. All in all remember your ability to make plays on side lanes with your ult is still equally strong here if not stronger so if you are losing teamfights go get your team an advantage through plays on side."

        "Early: The early game is the easiest most straightforward part, you clear 30 seconds faster, you are 10x stronger in fights I think your main priority on your first clear should be to make a play on bot lane before Vi and then secure crab. On the second clear use your lane prios to start stacking drakes early as creating a wincon like dragon soul will make this game much more simpler as Vi thrives on games filled with chaos. If you don't have prio, gank then shift into drake it wont be hard to do so given your much stronger skirmishing power.",
        "Mid: In the mid game, stick to soul stacking, vision is pretty important especially around objectives as lazy set ups will alow for vi to utilize his strong pick potential from Q and R to catch your teammates in transition. In fights playing against Vi is extremely difficult, you need to be smart enough to not get caught by her ult and the way you do this is by ensuring you never overstep this allows you to do 2 things, first vi wont be able to ult you in a position where her team can focus you down while your team can't attack her. 2. If you are in a safe position and further away from Vi, if vi does in fact ult you, you have way more time to react to and buffer Vi's ult with your own Ult. On top of this, I would advise buying control wards and keeping trinket because Vi is really good at getting free picks in the mid game with her point and click CC, if you can get vision for your strongside to make sure he doesn't die it would be extremely valuable.",
        "Late: In the late game, the main thing you need to watch out for is again Vi ult to catch you out, again the importance of staying aligned with your team and not overextending is extremely important. The rules of vision also apply however this is now mainly your support's job and sweeper is key, your job is now to arrive to objectives first because if Vi gains vision control he can be extremely dangerous through either multi man ults or an easy pick off with her combo. Obviously if you are first, you can do the same thing just as well if not better, your kit is built upon taking out one target quickly so if you force the enemy to facecheck, you will either get the objectives or a very favourable fight. Again just remember to warn your sidelaners if Vi can be looking for them because outside of teamfighting, Vi is also really good at getting picks on sides and pings can be extremely useful."

Along the same lines, you also want to make sure you don't overextend because Viego is extremely strong at bursting one target down, much like you. With your slightly faster clear speed, you should move into a position to look to chunk out Viego when he's looking for a play after his full clear. If enemy laners are not giving you free ganks, look to play for positioning and chunk out viego on both of the first 2 clears and try to translate it into kills and drake.",
        "Mid: After your 1st item, you will be stronger than Viego unless you go the cosmic drive build, this means you should take any fight you can if they are on your terms keep in mind however that Viego does have a lot of burst so if you misposition or get caught by enemy CC, you can still die but in skirmishes and 1v1s unless viego gets a reset you decimate him and can almost burst him 100 to 0 off your combo. It's also smart in skirmishes to not insta R unless viego already casts his ult because it will allow you to match his ult's reposition and not give him a way out. In addition, remember to ALWAYS FOCUS VIEGO in fights, not only is he extremely squishy, but if you allow him to get a reset he can completely take over a fight, take him out early and quick and you will win the fights easy. As always, objective control and soul stacking is important, fights around objectives also benefit you more because Viego is really strong in random fights that are full chaotic due to the ease in which he gets resets.",
        "Late: At this point in the game Viego is at his most dangerous because of how much burst he has that will alow him to get a reset. So, to counteract this just play fights smart, make sure you have info of where viego is and the second viego jumps in to try to secure a reset or dish out damage, you are fisting him. Again, just like in other matchups but even more important here, you have to arrive at objectives early because this will allow you to gain info on viego and deny enemy info and easy resets off of you and your team. Lastly, remember NEVER ULT IN unless the fight is clearly won, ulting in is a very easy way to give over a reset as it will leave you stranded so until you kill viego or the fight is won, play patient."

On the second clear because you are so much faster, you should either be able to go drake with your teams prios or utilize your clear speed advantage to make a play on either bot and mid, force prio then translate that into the dragon.

In teamfights warwick is extremely useless, it's only the 1v1 and 2v2 skirmishes that he's useful (even though you are still stronger than him in these if you are at an even pace). The easiest way to gain an advantage in this matchup is just to not skip your camps, warwick clears extremely slow while you do the opposite, you can easily get a 1-2 level lead just by clearing your camps and then making a play while warwick has to make the decision between either skipping his camps or not helping his team. If you ignore your camps and just go for reckless fights, you are giving away a huge advantage you have over warwick.",

Do try to focus him down unless there is a much better target because he can still be a nuisance with his crowd control and he's also just really easy to kill for you. If your carries are low remember warwick ult gets increased range and he gets increased movement speed, so make sure you are in position to deny warwick an engage onto them. Lastly, just like in mid game use your faster clear speed and MS to get to objective set ups first and force them to facecheck into you, play the game objective focused and you will not struggle in this matchup at all if you fight recklessly, you will be dancing to warwick's tune."

Finally, keep your ult as an engage tool only if the enemy is very out of position, otherwise if you can save your ult to buffer Wukong ult either to reposition yourself to avoid damage, or just to buffer it to maximize your damage and minimize CC, it will serve you well.",
        "Late Game: In the late game Wukong is a teamfight menace, but only if you allow him to do so. You can mitigate Wukong's teamfighting ability by denying him the opportunities of flanks and effectively MARKING him. You can do this by setting up good vision making sure you use your superior clear speed to get vision first, you can also do this by putting yourself in his shoes, how will he look to engage, when he W's make sure you are instantly Qing and ready to stun him as soon as he jumps in so he can't unleash his combo. Wukong is not a tanky champion, if you focus on peeling him from your carries instead of going in, you will find the late game to be significantly easier."

In the second clear look to go for drake if you have prio, if you don't have prio go gank into drake, just like the first clear xin wont be able to gank on your timer and full clear the same time, abuse this by looking for an unmatachable gank then look for drake. If you do skirmish, make sure you don't waste Q and have it in the fight, also make sure you don't overextend because xin's only threat is on you if you overextend.",
        "Mid: After your 1st item, unless you go cosmic, you will be stronger than xin but he does have the damage to shred you if you overextend. In matchups like these, objective control is extremely important, use your faster clear to create ganks and pressure and try to translate this to being first at the objective and having good set up for the objective. One common mistake people make is they forget about clearing especially vs slow clearing champs like Xin and they just make it a fiesta, remember a key advantage you have vs Xin is your clear speed, abuse this, maximize Xp and Gold then look for plays. In skirmishes wait for xin to jump in and focus him, if you go in it's easy for him to play because his ult allows him to not take damage from your team, if he goes in however, your team has a much easier time damaging him.",
        "Late: At this point in the game Xin zhao is a strong teamfighter prehaps more so than you, your job in fights is just to mitigate him. To mitigate him you need to be smart with your cooldowns, try to use your Q to stall out his ult, deny him entrances on the back line and big ults and just stick on xin in fights. Personally just like in the mid game, I find being passive and waiting for xin to make the mistake to be more effective but going for short trades with your Q + combo to bait out the xin zhao ult and then exiting is a common strategy you can use. A big advantage you have here is the ability to dive on side, xin is a champ that loves grouping so if he npc goes and arams, go to side lane and dive enemy, get yourself a numbers advantage and then play the map."

In fights it's a good idea to just look to kill zac insta, hes a tank but not tanky at all at this stage of the game. Kill him and you take away a lot of cc that can impact fights. Remember when goin for ganks you track where zac can be because his E slingshotallows him to match ganks he is far away from.",
        "Mid: In the mid game, your priorities lie in soul stacking still, random fights especially when your ult is down is horrible, Zac's heavy CCing kit makes it so that unless you have ult, if you ever misposition you are just going to be CCd for 40 years and die. So, make sure everyfight you take is good or you are simply giving Zac the change to snowball into the game, in fights try to insta stun zac so he can't get a nasty engage off right after he jumps in, if this means you can CC, it's worth it if you defend your team. Vision control is mega important into zac as his E allows him to come from many blind spots and punish overextending laners, this isn't just on sides but is especially dangerous on mid, I think the best places to put wards are actually on zac's camps so you can identify approximately where he will be just by looking at the way he cleared his camps. In fights don't go in unless you see Zac as if you go in, you give Zac a massived engage opportunity on your team or an easy pick opportunity on you.",
        "Late: In the late game Zac is extremely tanky so focusing him down might not be the best idea if you get to pick, if he jumps onto your backline however, you have to focus on peeling him off with your Q  E or R Slow. To ensure you get good fights, vision control and being earlier to objectives is again, extremely improtant as it allows oyu to identify any brave, zac engages onto your team. If you get caught remember to not greed your ult because if you do, you will land in a 6 second chain cc combo and live to regret it.

So, you need to be hyperfocused on clear, remember in this matchup if you get to the mid game somewhat even it is extremely free, if you dont he can snowball. It's very important you find out where zed starts, and ping the opposite lane (the lane he's pathing to) at 2:55 that he can be there and gank, this will take away zeds strength of using his quick first clear to cheese gank. In skirmishes, if you are even level you will win, if you have prio look to start soul stacking early because it gives you an easy win con that will stop your team from dying random deaths in the mid game . Remember if you do end up doing drake that Zed can one shot the drake from like 1100 hp so avoid letting him in the pit if possible.",
        "Mid: In the mid game, you are stronger than Zed after each item spike but until your 2nd item spike, or tabis, he can deal damage to you if you get CCd or especially if you are low because his passive allows him to deal double the damage to you if you are below 50% hp. So, because Zed is both mobile and can take you out easily if you are low, it's EXTREMELY important you don't extend plays too much, rememeber your playpoints and once you secure them insta exit the play, if you try to overchase after you already secure the play you want, zed will be able to punish you hard. Macro wise , just like other matchups, try to play around objectives, zed's mobility allows him to thrive in chaos where he can get picks and snowball so if you keep the game simple, straightforward and around objectives the game will be extremely easy. In skirmishes, focus zed first, he kind of has to jump in to be useful so what I like doing is holding my Q and as soon as he lands from his ult, I insta stun him and burst him because this positioning is where is the most vulnerable (he is the furthest overextended and right next to your team)",
        "Late: In the late game, your role in skirmishes is the same, hoild your Q till zed ults in then insta stun him and burst you down. The late game is pretty straightforward tbh, play to peel your backline and try to set up good vision so you can identify any sneaky entrances Zed might take to try to take out your backline. One thing that you need to watch out for in the late game is Zed's mobility, this means if you are winning fights, you need to be aware of zed going through side lanes to try to pick your teammates off to create a numbers advantage."

In this matchup you kind of have to path bot because if you don't she can just easily dive your bot lane with plants in between two towers. In this matchup you kind of have to just try to stay in the game early on, after your clears always look to skirmish Zyra, you are way more useful in skirmishes and if you have a good flash angle on her which can allow your team to follow up, it is almost always a guranteed kill. This is one of the matchups where drake is hard to get early but its more than enough if you just deny Zyra from taking the drake, keep trinket throughout the early game and put it on drakes to deny Zyra from sneaking drakes.",
        "Mid: After your 1st item if you went with the cosmic build, the game will be easier, use cosmic movement speed to try to get on top of zyra and if you get on top of her, you simply can't lose the skirmishes. Remember, champions like Zyra struggle a lot when you are decisive and crowd her, this will be difficult if you are late to objectives because, to get to her you will have to take significant damage from the plants she has set up. This is why it is key, around objectives or skirmishes, you are the first party there, this will deny Zyra the ability to set up plants that can chunk you out so hard it makes it not worth for you to run into her. If you do get chunked out by zyra and have camps up, your W is really good to heal you back up so you can leave a fight, heal off a camp then re-enter a fight.",
        "Late: At this point in the game Zyra is extremely strong in fights, your goal still doesn't change however, you need to crowd her in fights and not give her the freedom to spam cast her spells without having to click back. Hopefully by this time you are decently tanky and despite Zyras build, the champion does struggle to kill you before you kill her if you can just get on top of her with ult. Again the most important thing in this matchup is to get to plays first, don't let her set up plants and vision and force her to having to facecheck into you. The best thing about this matchup is that for zyra to spawn plants, her range is the exact same as your ult range, this means if she facechecks you, even if she snares you if you slight buffer it with R she eithr has to flash or die. Just remember to be decisive in this matchup and it will be significantly easier."
