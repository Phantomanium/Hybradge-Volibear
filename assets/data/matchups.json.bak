        "Early: Abuse Amumu's early game as hard as possible. Utilize your faster full clear speed to pressure lanes before him, and on your second clear, look to do Dragon. You are far stronger than him at this point in the game and can brute force objectives, not only because you will be there much earlier but also because he can't fight you at all, especially when you have already stacked your passive on Dragon.",
        "Mid game: Invading is rather valuable as long as you can guarantee that enemy laners can't move to rotate, because despite Amumu having a lot of CC, his damage is still rather low. As long as you can make sure to get multiple procs of your W, you will find the skirmishes to be easy. The biggest mistake you can make in the mid-game is to overextend without your team and get caught. There are mainly two goals you want to have in fights:",
        "1. You have to deny Amumu's engage on your team. This can be done just by CCing him with your Q. However, make sure you don't ever overextend yourself so that Amumu can't just one-man ult you and pick you off. Deny him, but do it from a safe distance. You might find it easy to do this by standing a bit in front of your team but a bit to the left or the right; this way, even if he goes on you, he is trading his own life.",
        "2. You have to not overextend to a point where you get picked off alone. This means you have to be selective with your fights. Play fights within your own vision and look to get picks that way. It is much easier to stay safe from enemy damage if you are the one controlling the vision and making the enemy facecheck, so prioritize control wards and your sweeper around objectives.",
        "Late Game: At this point, you struggle the most. While you have a good bit of tenacity, it still won't be enough to keep you safe in fights. As a result, it is very important for you to play through side lanes. While you might not win in 5v5s, 3v3s, 2v2s, and 1v1s are all really advantageous for you. So, choose to fight where they have fewer numbers, and your chances of winning will increase dramatically. Make sure to use the mechanics we've already talked about, as they can genuinely be the difference between a won and a lost fight."

As a result, the easiest way to punish her in this matchup is to use your clear speed advantage (approximately 15 seconds) to either gank lanes before she can respond or invade her on her final camp. When it comes to objectives, you'll always be able to take them because your 1v1 is far superior to Bel'Veth's, and so is your 2v2.

The best tip I can give you is to stay patient and use your Q when she dashes in and is right next to you.",

Feel free to use all your abilities on diana as she is always readily available for you to use W on.",
        "Mid: Use your Q to deny Diana big combos on your team with her ult, just make sure you press Q and insta right click her because if you do, even though you don't cancel the dash, she will be stunned after the dash and you significantly diminish the chances she has in creating an engage. If you are struggling to find spots to punish her just objective stack and she will be forced to fight you eventually.",
        "Late: Your role from mid to late doesnt change much, focus the first target and deny Diana's engage, you are stronger in fights just make sure you don't overextend and let diana make that mistake. In these skirmishes stacking passive and lethal tempo will increase your fighting prowess signfiicantly so whenever you can auto champions even if they are hyper tanks or even just minions is really important in allowing you to dish out damage."

The only chance she has in contesting you at objectives is with the extended CC from her charm but given she is not invisible at this point it is hard for her to hit it since your Q gives you movement speed to space evelynn.",
        "Mid: After your 1st item you are extremely strong even if she gets her charm off, however, it is key that you don't let her poke you with her combo and charm, so make sure when you are fighting her, you have the ability to play extended fights in other words, you must play in neutral areas and areas with vision .",
        "Late: At this point of the game, Evelynn has the ability to one shot everyone, this is why you must play teamfights where her ability to assasinate is significantly reduced. It is also important that you are there early for objectives because due to her low defensive/hp stats and your 1 second stun from Q her ability to facecheck is extremely limited even though she has Ult as insurance. Another important thing to do is buy control wards so she can't look for sneaky angles and threaten you carries, a control ward at this point of the game is stronger than any base item."

In fights you must watch fiddlesticks as it is not uncommon for fiddlesticks to channel ults even if they are in the thick of fights, your low Q cd will give you the ability to cancel his ult before he casts it so all you have to do is pay attention to him."

Alternatively, you can also chain Q E and R on Gragas to go for a certain pick but again you have to make sure the enemy has no CC to stunlock you and that your team can follow up.

Objectives are always free because Ivern has no fighting prowess, invades are hard even though Ivern has to mark his camps because he is still faster on his clear, so make sure your plays are on lanes and objectives instead. Importantly make sure to ward the opposite side of what you're starting level 1 because Ivern can cheese your camps and especially a buff level 1.",
        "Mid: At this point fights are really hard if you don't dictate what happens, Ivern takes away one of your biggest strengths of punishing facechecks with his bushes so you have to rely on good macro. There are two types of plays you should go for, 1. plays on ivern with your Ult buffering his snare, this will work is because if you focus ivern his champ is much less useful. it will be difficult to get onto him though so you need to find unique angles to go on him. 2. Plays on side are extremely strong, Ivern is a champion that wants to group because he finds strength the more numbers around him and the more frontline he has, and thus has the tendency to overgroup, he will not be able to match your mobility to make plays on side and he will also have less coverage, making it easier to punish him",
        "Late: At this point of the game, Ivern is extremely dangerous, he can one shot you with his Q and his ult is extremely dangerous, he can one shot your backline and you. This is why you must play teamfights where his ability to assasinate is significantly reduced. It is also important that you are there early for objectives because due to his low defensive/hp stats and your 1 second stun from Q his ability to facecheck is extremely limited even though he has Ult as insurance. Another important thing to do is buy control wards so he can't look for sneaky angles and threaten you carries, a control ward at this point of the game is stronger than any base item."

When going for objectives, ensure you have prio and correct setup, as Jarvan can match your early prowess and carelessness can be deadly. He can't outsmite if you chain your E damage with Smite.",

Do not greed your ult if he combos you, since deaths at this stage often lead to objectives—which you want to control in such a close matchup. In fights, focus the first target and avoid standing too close to your team; this just gives Jarvan a valuable multi-man ult. Make sure he either ults your team or you, not both. Also avoid trading ult for ult with him because yours has a longer CD—position respectfully.",

Use in-and-out zoning pressure on their carries with your Q and ult, and always mark the Jarvan in fights. Do not start fights when he is out of vision; his damage is underrated late and his ability to set up big combos is similar to Fiddlesticks—keep track of his position."

You will decimate karthus in skirmishes but still try to avoid as many Qs as possible as they still do damage. You can always secure objectives in this matchup as it is hard for him to kill you on objectives given your healing from W and shield from E.",

Regarding skirmishes you don't have to focus karthus but given karthus doesnt have the longest range and is quite squishy, you can punish him quite easily. In addition, make sure you secure all the objectives possible because karthus does scale like a monster so you need some scaling factor to combat him."

This is why if you are not starting raptors or red, ward the raptors. On 2nd clear try to stack objectives, importantly you want to pull the objective because Kayn can get into the pit and steal it easily with E also remember to secure objectives with E chained with smite",

That being said after form kayn is extremely mobile and can snowball the game, this is why deep vision and info of Kayn's whereabouts is extremely valuable in denying Kayn's ability to snowball.especially on side lanes. Again, the key to winning matchups like these is stacking objectives, you want to make sure you reduce random fighting which gives kayn the opportunity to snowball and rather focus on stacking objectives so you have an eventual win con that will combat Kayn's insane late game prowess.",
        "Late Game: At this point in the game, while Kayn is extremely strong, you can still probably beat him in a 1v1 if he is in blue form. Yet, a good kayn will never try to 1v1 you and would try to poke you and get out, that's why its important to group with your team as much as you can and try to punish Kayn in teamfights. In fights you need to be extremely patient with your Q, Kayn always has to eventually jump in to damage so you need to be patient and wait for that opportunity to stun him. In fights you have to watch out for kayn due to his extreme burst potential so until you see kayn make sure you don't blow all your cooldowns as it can be costly. In addition to this vision control is important because the less control you have, the easier of a time kayn has to pick your teammates. Make sure to use pings to alert your team of potential kayn engages as well, it will help a lot."

After 2 items you are much more tanky and you can be a bit careless, but throughout the mid game you want to continue stacking objectives as again, Khazix struggles significantly in teamfights when champions are grouped up so playing around objectives makes it easy and straightforward for you to play the game out in addition to giving you a clear win con to play for (soul stacking)",

Having understood this, stacking objectives is a bit harder and you would really need good set up from your lanes t otake any objective. My advice would be to try to gank a lane first so you can gurantee a numbers advantage before you play for any objective. Remember lee sin can secure objectives with his Q so don't let him gain entry towards the objective. Remember in fights Q towards the end of your E so you can gurantee it landing.",

Remeber to chain E with your Q in order to gurantee damage output on him. In this matchup its really important to stack objectives from early just because Yi can always just hyper scale off 1 good fight so make sure on the 2nd rotation you are already looking at the possibility of drake if your lane states allow it.

Now to avoid this, use your faster clear speed to get to objectives early and set up vision with your support, don't waste time going for pointless ganks as wasted time allows Yi to get into a favourable position around objectives to win the skirmish so just full clear &gt; objective setup &gt; objective and try to play the game with a controlled formula.

So, the way you play the game is again by playing good macro, track naafiri before fights, make sure your side laners are aware if she could be there and never ever go for reckless engages and focus on denying Naafiri opportunities in fights instead.

What you can also do, if nocturne ults you, is to R back to your team so Nocturne will be out of position and you can easily take out an enemy before the fight even commences. Now, if nocturne ults one of your teammates, you must insta rotate to kill nocturne because at this point his burst is significant and can take out one of your carries easily.

While nunu is not a threat in teamfights, nunu's champion specializes in being able to generate picks on sides so again, pings, controlwards and vision set up are extremely important.

Pathing to bot in this matchup is also really valuable as in a matchup so even, the one that takes the objective leads generally has the easier path in the mid to late game. Remember to not instantly blow your whole combo on Pantheon before he E's, personally in some situations I even like to use my Q and W insta, and hold E until after he Es.

In fights remember try to attack pantheon from front and back so he can't E all of your damage and never make plays on side when pantheon still has ult because his countergnaking potential and global ult are really broken at this stage of the game. In fights, if pantheon ults and jumps on backline try to peel him off, you should be able to do that easily and punish his overextended position.",

Q E R is good undodgeable combo on poppy if you want to rush snap engage him.",
        "Early: In the early game, you have a clear speed advantage, use it to get first gank on bot and in fights just make sure you don't stand next to a wall so poppy can't just E you and stun you for like 2 years because despite you being stronger in skirmishes, Poppy E along with teammates followup won't even give you the opportunity to flash. You should put priority on drakes at this point in the game, poppy is a very even matchup so objective taking will dictate the result of the game. Always put a ward on enemy raptors in this matchup because poppy can go for a lot of creative ganks so being able to track him to deny such opportunites is extremely important.",
        "Mid game: In the mid game keep it simple, fighting around objectives, make sure you are there to set up vision first because if you are facechecking poppy has a lot of unique tools to punish you including Eing you into a wall to one shot or ulting you away and making the fight a 5v4. In objectives watch out for poppy's ult because he can throw you out of the fight and rob you of the drake very easily, don't greed your ult, if you think her ult might hit you just use your ult to buffer it and you won't be knocked away. Skirmishes inside of the jungle tend to not be the best due to the vast amount of walls Poppy can E you on so unless you have an advantage, try to keep most fights in the lane where poppy's short range can be punished by your ranged carries.",
        "Late Game: In the late game just make sure you don't ever give poppy the ability to CC you because her CD's are so short she can chain one mistake into a 8 second CC lock, especially if you don't have mercs. So, keep an eye out for her W, if she does W wait it out then engage, keep an eye out for your position relative to walls, her hitbox on E is completely BS so don't even risk it. Again be first on objective set ups and use your Ult to buffer her ult if needed, it's really worth trading ult for ult. In fights, let poppy engage and counter her engage she is tanky but also often overextended if she wants to engage which allows your team to kill her easily."

So, you need to make sure you farm but also if you are ahead go counter jungle this will help you keep track of where Qiyana is but also put you ahead in a rough matchup. Regarding objectives you need to set them up well, if qiyana gets a flank the fight is over, if qiyan gets a big ult the fight is over so you must deny her as much info as possible and you should always look to focus and peel her in fights. Remember don't flip smites vs Qiyana because she can secure smites from 2k hp with her Ult and Q."

This stage of the game objective should always be yours rammus really doesn't have a steal threat and he definitely doesn't have the combat prowess to contest objective skirmishes or objective positioning. Remember either build you go, rammus doesn't really block most of your damage (cleaver armor cut/ cosmic is ap) so he is not as tanky vs you as he would typically be vs bruisers just use your auto cancel mechanics and you will melt him like butter. Also it can be easy to just fall in love with fighting make sure before you fight you cycle your camps because you're much faster at doing that and if he wants to match your skirmishing you will gain an xp and gold lead from the camp lead you will have."

        "Early: You have a clear speed advantage, use it to impact lanes faster but 1. don't overchase the ganks, if you can't make a quick play take the flash and be happy 2. when exiting from a gank, if you are low becareful of walking into bushes, Rengar can do a surprising amount of damage. On your second clear, try to look for a gank into drake, at this point in the game rengar is only strong if you fight around bushes so if you have control and stay within drake pit rengar's threat is extremely low. Make sure that you escort your laners though or at least have good vision because from experience Rengar tends to have the ability to pick off your laners moving to help yiou with drake.",
        "Mid game: In the mid game Rengar is only useful when he has 2 things, bush control or ult. Now, by far the most important thing when playing against Rengar is you never facecheck bushes if you don't have either numbers or vision. Now vision is great to have and it's easy to get, simply be first on objectives and you will always have the vision control. However, there will be some instances where you are late so you need to have numbers, the easiest way to ensure you have numbers if by pushing mid wave first and then moving. By this doing you force someone on the enemy team to respond to the wave while your entire team is freed up because there is n owave to push. This way you completely negate Rengar's ability to use bushes to get free picks. Regarding rengar's ult, in fights just let him go in, when he ults he is on a timer so he has to force it eventually if you go in while he pops ult, you just give him easy access into your backline. What you should instead do is let him make the play and then insta focus him once he ults in, never dive for backline always stay on the rengar!"

        "Early: Utilize your clear speed advantage to be the first to make plays, in the early game your advantage lies in 1v1s, your disadvantage lies in the fact that in 2v2s or 3v3s, sejuani can chain cc you long enough for her team to kill you so just becareful you don't overextend and you will be fine. If you want to take objectives at this stage of the game, you have to have proper set up because Sejuani has a lot of damage early game and as said earlier they can burst you so don't underestimate her just because of her tanky nature and ensure lanes are pushed and vision is set up.",
        "Mid game: This is the part of the game where you can generate the biggest lead, in the mid game sejuani players will always overuse their tempot to try to create players so what you need to do is either match these plays and if you can't, try to create invades and generate a camp lead. Remember just cause sejuani is skipping her camps doesn't mean you should be doing the same thing, her champion is far lower econ than you so it is in her interest if you skip camps and amtch her on 50/50 plays. Sure, if you can match her and get a kill do so, but if your laners are safe don't skip camps unless you need to. In addition, in matchups like this make sure you take as many objectives as you can, skipping camps to be there to set up the objective is advantageous because sejuani's champion is stronger when you have no info as it allows her to go for creative engages with her ult and get a pick before the fight even starts so if you need to skip camps to acquire vision do so. In fights very simple, focus the first target sejuani isn't mega tanky at this point and you have the damage to wreck her, if she ults you you can either ult away if the fight is bad or ult on her if the fight is good and slight buffer the stun.",
        "Late Game: At this point Sejuani is the strongest, her ult is on low Cd and she wil often just throw it out to fish for plays. What this means is you need to be good enough to make sure you never are far up enough that you can be killed without your team being able to retaliate, hopefully by this point you have enough tenacity to frontline, use this to spearhead your team when you are trying to take zones of vision, if enemy team is there first, push waves force them to respond then retake the vision. In fights it'll be common for you to use ult defensively, this is really good at this point because your ult damage is negligible so if you want to trade ult for ult in important fight, do so. Remember however your ult has a longer cd so don't trade ults unless it's close to an objective timer. Finally in fights just try to survive and frontline as long as possible, use your W's on sej because she is a very accessible target and can keep you healing throiughout the fight."

        "Early: This is the toughest part of the game to navigate, this is the only matchup in the game where yo u want to start sweeper, then what you want to do is around 1:15, invade enemy raptors with sweeper and take out all of shaco's boxes. The reason you want to do this is so that Shaco can't lvl 2 cheese you on your camps and just make the early game a cheesefest and gain a significant lead. Now if you don't do this, the easiest way to play against shaco is just to expect him to be on your camps this means pulling camps into bushes will help significantly. After the first clear the matchup becomes infinitely easier, just play like normal, get prio into stacking drakes, don't be afraid to play 3v3s but be awarwe of what summoner spell shaco has because if he has ignite it can sway these fights massively. In addition, when going for ganks just be aware shaco can be there he has insane mobility and his much faster clear speed will allow him to do so, it is for this reason that its also good just to ping your laners to becareful at around 3:05-3:10 because shaco can gank them on this timer.",
        "Mid game: In the mid game, if shaco goes ap the boxes can be extremely annoying so again sweeper AND control wards are key to denying him this especially around objectives. Again because boxes are so op, being at objectives first allows you to deny shaco boxes and it also forces him to facecheck into you which gives you a timer to punish him if not kill him. In fights if you mark shaco its easy to kill the right one but even if you don't just look at who is taking more damage and you will know that is the clone because shaco clones always take more damage than the real version. Your role in fights is simply to either kill the first target or protect your carries, this can mean the same thing and if shaco does go on your teammates, turn all your attention onto him and it will take away a lot of his power."

On the second clear you should almost always go for drake unless the lane states are horrible, Skarner has no means to last hit a drake (he has no burst) and he also is pretty much never going to get to the drake on time to contest because of his slow clearing speed.

        "Early: You have a faster clear than Taliyah however since Taliyah has fast movement speed with her passive, unless enemies are mega pushed up, she will likely be able to somewhat counter your gank so it's important to acknowledge this and if a gank isn't likely, playing for a pick on taliyah finishing her clear or playing for positioning for scuttle is significantly better.On second clear, look to do drake if you can secure vision control, taliyah is horrible at facechecking so if she does you can even flash stun on her and you will anhilate her. If you don't have prio then make sure you are aware of entering bushes because even at this stage, Taliyah has pretty good burst when you facecheck her. Mid: After level 6 you hard fist taliyah whenever you want to, always just ult on her and you will be able to kill her easily, she can never survive if you enter into melee range of her so if she walks up just ult on her uneless she has help nearby. After your 1st item, the game becomes infinitely easier, you will be able to steamroll Taliyah even if you just hit an E. Honestly the important thing to do in the mid game is just take control, if you do she can't facecheck and all the objectives are free, if she gets positioning it could prove troublesome if you don't react to Ws so if you are late, keep your eyes peeled for Taliyah W's from out of vision. Remember Taliyah ult allows her to match your plays on side if you ever go for them so just respect that and ensure you include the possible presence of her when going for plays."

If you have good prio for drakes they will be free, Talon struggles in straight up brawls and is more dependant on catching people in transition and snowballing off of it, this is why vision is import and just going and playing for objectives where your team is grouped up will deny him that opportunity whilst giving you the soul win con.",
        "Mid game: In the mid game this is where Talon can snowball leads and is thus the most dangerous. There are 2 things you must do, 1st its important you are always clearing your camps and not making random plays, if the plays you go for are not done when your camps are down, talon will use his 4 billion dashes to take your camps this will put him at a huge Xp surplus so it's extremely important you make plays after you finish full clears. The second thing you should do is set up good vision and hover your side lanes if need be, talon is extremely mobile and can pick off your side lanes at ease, vision will help but pings are probably way more important. The most important thing is to deny your laners from dying stupid deaths, just hover them to push out the lanes so they won't have to be in a dangerous position by themselves. In fights just let talon jump in and then play, you never want to be the one engaging because when you engage you leave gaps and holes this allows Talon to thrive in the position he wants the most so its easier if you play counter-engage in this matchup rather than engage."

So, the best play you can make in fights is chunk trundle out with your combo then when he ults you insta run away with cosmic movement speed.

That being said if trundle ults you, you can't just stand there and brawl with him just like in mid game you need to space him and if that means you don't kill trundle, you can be happy with taking his ult- the only spell that gives him any relevance at this stage of the game. Again, being first to objectives is nice as it allows you to have that ability to space trundle if need be, making plays on sides are also well advised because trundle is kind of immobile and prefers to go for teamfights in the jungle with all of his team."

If you have prios, try to take the drake after your 2nd full clear, if you don't, Udyr will try to take the drake on 2nd clear try to deny him even if you are late to it as you should be stronger than him at skirmishes, and your single target burst is way higher so just focus one target and the skirmishes are won.",

Even when objectives are down, instead of trying to go for even, 4v4 or 3v3 skirmishes mid, you can utilize your ult to go for creative plays on sides to try to create a numbers advantage and a gold lead for your team."

        "Early: The early game is the easiest most straightforward part, you clear 30 seconds faster, you are 10x stronger in fights I think your main priority on your first clear should be to make a play on bot lane before Vi and then secure crab. On the second clear use your lane prios to start stacking drakes early as creating a wincon like dragon soul will make this game much more simpler as Vi thrives on games filled with chaos. If you don't have prio, gank then shift into drake it wont be hard to do so given your much stronger skirmishing power.",
        "Mid game: In the mid game, stick to soul stacking, vision is pretty important especially around objectives as lazy set ups will alow for vi to utilize his strong pick potential from Q and R to catch your teammates in transition. In fights playing against Vi is extremely difficult, you need to be smart enough to not get caught by her ult and the way you do this is by ensuring you never overstep this allows you to do 2 things, first vi wont be able to ult you in a position where her team can focus you down while your team can't attack her. 2. If you are in a safe position and further away from Vi, if vi does in fact ult you, you have way more time to react to and buffer Vi's ult with your own Ult. On top of this, I would advise buying control wards and keeping trinket because Vi is really good at getting free picks in the mid game with her point and click CC, if you can get vision for your strongside to make sure he doesn't die it would be extremely valuable."

Along the same lines, you also want to make sure you don't overextend because Viego is extremely strong at bursting one target down, much like you. With your slightly faster clear speed, you should move into a position to look to chunk out Viego when he's looking for a play after his full clear. If enemy laners are not giving you free ganks, look to play for positioning and chunk out viego on both of the first 2 clears and try to translate it into kills and drake.",
        "Mid: After your 1st item, you will be stronger than Viego unless you go the cosmic drive build, this means you should take any fight you can if they are on your terms keep in mind however that Viego does have a lot of burst so if you misposition or get caught by enemy CC, you can still die but in skirmishes and 1v1s unless viego gets a reset you decimate him and can almost burst him 100 to 0 off your combo. It's also smart in skirmishes to not insta R unless viego already casts his ult because it will allow you to match his ult's reposition and not give him a way out. In addition, remember to ALWAYS FOCUS VIEGO in fights, not only is he extremely squishy, but if you allow him to get a reset he can completely take over a fight, take him out early and quick and you will win the fights easy. As always, objective control and soul stacking is important, fights around objectives also benefit you more because Viego is really strong in random fights that are full chaotic due to the ease in which he gets resets."

In teamfights warwick is extremely useless, it's only the 1v1 and 2v2 skirmishes that he's useful (even though you are still stronger than him in these if you are at an even pace). The easiest way to gain an advantage in this matchup is just to not skip your camps, warwick clears extremely slow while you do the opposite, you can easily get a 1-2 level lead just by clearing your camps and then making a play while warwick has to make the decision between either skipping his camps or not helping his team. If you ignore your camps and just go for reckless fights, you are giving away a huge advantage you have over warwick.",

Do try to focus him down unless there is a much better target because he can still be a nuisance with his crowd control and he's also just really easy to kill for you. If your carries are low remember warwick ult gets increased range and he gets increased movement speed, so make sure you are in position to deny warwick an engage onto them. Lastly, just like in mid game use your faster clear speed and MS to get to objective set ups first and force them to facecheck into you, play the game objective focused and you will not struggle in this matchup at all if you fight recklessly, you will be dancing to warwick's tune."

Finally, keep your ult as an engage tool only if the enemy is very out of position, otherwise if you can save your ult to buffer Wukong ult either to reposition yourself to avoid damage, or just to buffer it to maximize your damage and minimize CC, it will serve you well.",
        "Late Game: In the late game Wukong is a teamfight menace, but only if you allow him to do so. You can mitigate Wukong's teamfighting ability by denying him the opportunities of flanks and effectively MARKING him. You can do this by setting up good vision making sure you use your superior clear speed to get vision first, you can also do this by putting yourself in his shoes, how will he look to engage, when he W's make sure you are instantly Qing and ready to stun him as soon as he jumps in so he can't unleash his combo. Wukong is not a tanky champion, if you focus on peeling him from your carries instead of going in, you will find the late game to be significantly easier."

So, make sure everyfight you take is good or you are simply giving Zac the change to snowball into the game, in fights try to insta stun zac so he can't get a nasty engage off right after he jumps in, if this means you can CC, it's worth it if you defend your team. Vision control is mega important into zac as his E allows him to come from many blind spots and punish overextending laners, this isn't just on sides but is especially dangerous on mid, I think the best places to put wards are actually on zac's camps so you can identify approximately where he will be just by looking at the way he cleared his camps.

So, because Zed is both mobile and can take you out easily if you are low, it's EXTREMELY important you don't extend plays too much, rememeber your playpoints and once you secure them insta exit the play, if you try to overchase after you already secure the play you want, zed will be able to punish you hard. Macro wise , just like other matchups, try to play around objectives, zed's mobility allows him to thrive in chaos where he can get picks and snowball so if you keep the game simple, straightforward and around objectives the game will be extremely easy. In skirmishes, focus zed first, he kind of has to jump in to be useful so what I like doing is holding my Q and as soon as he lands from his ult, I insta stun him and burst him because this positioning is where is the most vulnerable (he is the furthest overextended and right next to your team)"

      "tips": [
        "Skill upgrade: Q max, W max, E max",
        "Important Mechanics: Use your R to buffer Zyra ult knockup, you can also slight buffer Zyra E with your ult. Always Q to chase Zyra even if she has E because even if you get hit it will reset your Q",
        "Early: Zyra has a clear speed advantage over you (2:56 full clear), if you clear slow she can invade you on your last camp so be aware of this when clearing. In this matchup you kind of have to path bot because if you don't she can just easily dive your bot lane with plants in between two towers. In this matchup you kind of have to just try to stay in the game early on, after your clears always look to skirmish Zyra, you are way more useful in skirmishes and if you have a good flash angle on her which can allow your team to follow up, it is almost always a guranteed kill. This is one of the matchups where drake is hard to get early but its more than enough if you just deny Zyra from taking the drake, keep trinket throughout the early game and put it on drakes to deny Zyra from sneaking drakes.",
        "Mid: After your 1st item if you went with the cosmic build, the game will be easier, use cosmic movement speed to try to get on top of zyra and if you get on top of her, you simply can't lose the skirmishes. Remember, champions like Zyra struggle a lot when you are decisive and crowd her, this will be difficult if you are late to objectives because, to get to her you will have to take significant damage from the plants she has set up. This is why it is key, around objectives or skirmishes, you are the first party there, this will deny Zyra the ability to set up plants that can chunk you out so hard it makes it not worth for you to run into her. If you do get chunked out by zyra and have camps up, your W is really good to heal you back up so you can leave a fight, heal off a camp then re-enter a fight."
